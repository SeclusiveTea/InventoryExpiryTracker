# InventoryExpiryTracker

This was a tertiary project for a Mobile Apps Development paper. This was a group project.
It was created from a specification from a real client however due to confidentiality I have refactored the project into a generic Inventory Expiry Tracker.
The reason the selections are so small on this project is this was created for a very specific set of data and choices were made
to make the process easier for the user and keep the integrity of the data in the database.
