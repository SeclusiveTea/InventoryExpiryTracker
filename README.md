# InventoryExpiryTracker

This was a tertiary project for a Mobile Apps Development paper. This was a group project.

The aim was to create a prototype application to show the client what could be achieved in a mobile application for their use.

It was created from a specification from a real client however due to confidentiality I have refactored the project into a generic Inventory Expiry Tracker.
The reason the selections are so small on this project is this was created for a very specific set of data and choices were made
to make the process easier for the user and keep the integrity of the data in the database.

This project was presented to client and our group received a grade of A++ for this project.
